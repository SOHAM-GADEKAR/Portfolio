                        Achieved a milestone by securing an A grade in the Intermediate Grade Drawing Exam. This
                        accomplishment was particularly notable as only three students from our school earned an A grade
                        that year. The exam tested various aspects of artistic skill, including creativity, technique,
                        and attention to detail. This success highlighted my dedication to the arts and my ability to
                        excel under competitive conditions.

                        Intense C Language Course Completion and Award-Winning Bank Project

                        I recently completed an intensive C language course, where I significantly enhanced my
                        programming skills and
                        understanding of the C language. The course culminated in a comprehensive final project, a bank
                        management system, which
                        earned me 1st prize for its excellence and innovation.

                        <p>For two intense days, I solved numerous questions, gradually facing more difficult ones. By
                            the end, I proudly earned
                            <strong>4 stars and a silver badge</strong> within 24 hours, while also managing my
                            end-semester studies.
                        </p>

                        <p>This journey ignited my passion for setting ambitious goals and working hard to achieve them.
                            The new concepts I
                            learned were <strong>invaluable</strong> for my ATM system project and future coding
                            endeavors.</p>

                        <p>This experience taught me the importance of perseverance and pushing my limits, a drive that
                            helped me almost
                            complete my ATM project in just two days.</p>

                        <p>Developed an ATM System as a mini-project after completing a C language course. Key features
                            include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Utilization of double pointers for function argument passing and dynamic memory
                                allocation.</li>
                            <li>Core functionalities: New Entry, Search, Check Balance, Deposit, Withdraw.</li>
                            <li>Security code requirement for accessing the list of entries.</li>
                            <li>Enhanced user interface with ASCII values and logic.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>This project, completed in just two days, reinforced my understanding of pointers and memory

                        <p>In my first year, finding resources like books and notes was challenging. To help my peers, I
                            created a
                            <strong>one-stop platform</strong> with comprehensive materials including:

                            <li> Books</li>
                            <li> Notes</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>Using Google Sites, I designed a user-friendly website that quickly gained traction, reaching
                            hundreds of students.
                            Launched on February 9th, 2024, it was widely shared and well-received, reinforcing the
                            power of genuine intentions
                            and helping others.</p>
